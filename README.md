# Gender In Academia graphs

### Purpose
I am using key javascript libraries such as D3, DC, and Crossfilter to create an interactive dashboard.
The dashboard itself is laid out using Bootstrap (bootswatch theme) and the raw data relates to salaries and participation in academia broken down by gender.
I have utilised these libraries aswell as my knowledge of HTML, CSS and javascript to turn the raw data into useful visualizations.
For example, these percentages show that in the data set that we have, about 70% of men and less than half of women are at the level of professor.
I have also used bar charts to show comparative data and filtering data by clicking on the charts is made possible by the Crossfilter library.
Other charts we'll see include the stacked bar chart that you see here on the right.
In addition, I have also use scatter plots to show correlation, or the lack of correlation, between different attributes of the data for example There appears to be little or no correlation between salary and years of service.
